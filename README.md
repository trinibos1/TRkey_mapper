## üìÅ File Structure

This application is provided as a **single HTML file (`index.html`)** for ease of use. All HTML markup, CSS styling, and JavaScript/React logic are embedded within this file.

---

## üìã Requirements

* **Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge):** The Web Serial API, crucial for direct device communication, is primarily supported by these browsers.
* **Micropad device:** A Pico-powered micropad keyboard.
* **Micropad firmware:** Your device must be running compatible firmware that understands JSON configuration commands over serial (specifically, expecting a `layers.json` file containing keymap, peripheral, and macro data).

---

## üì° Communication Protocol (Web Serial)

The web application communicates with the Pico via a simple command-based serial protocol.

* **Baud Rate:** $115200$ bps
* **Line Endings:** All commands sent from the host (web app) to the Pico must be terminated with a newline character (`\n`).
* **Response Termination:** Responses from the Pico are terminated by specific markers:
    * `<EOF>`: End of File marker, used after sending file data (e.g., during `GET`).
    * `<END>`: End of message marker, used after sending text-based responses (e.g., during `DEL` success/failure).

Here's how specific file operations work:

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload (PUT)

The host initiates a file upload, then sends the raw byte data of the file.

1.  **Host sends:** `PUT <filename>\n` (e.g., `PUT layers.json\n`)
2.  **Host sends:** Raw binary data of the file in chunks.
3.  **Host sends:** `<EOF>` marker after all data is sent.
4.  **Pico Response:** The Pico processes the incoming data. A typical response after successful reception would be a simple confirmation message, often terminated by `<END>`.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Download (GET)

The host requests a file from the Pico, and the Pico responds by sending the file's raw byte data.

1.  **Host sends:** `GET <filename>\n` (e.g., `GET layers.json\n`)
2.  **Pico sends:** Raw binary data of the requested file in chunks.
3.  **Pico sends:** `<EOF>` marker after all data is sent.
4.  **Host Processing:** The web application reads data until `<EOF>` is received, then reconstructs the file from the received chunks.

### üóëÔ∏è Delete (DEL)

The host requests the Pico to delete a specified file.

1.  **Host sends:** `DEL <filename>\n` (e.g., `DEL layers.json\n`)
2.  **Pico Response:** The Pico attempts to delete the file. It sends a message indicating success or failure.
    * **Success Example:** `File layers.json deleted successfully.<END>`
    * **Failure Example:** `Error: File not found or could not be deleted.<END>`

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

* **Web Serial API:** Enables direct USB serial communication between the browser and your Pico.
* **Local Storage:** User profiles are persisted locally in your browser for quick access.
* **React & Tailwind CSS:** The UI is built using React for component-based development and styled efficiently with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.
* **`@babel/standalone`:** Used to transpile JSX directly in the browser, allowing the single-file React setup.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

* **Serial Connection Fails:**
    * Ensure your browser is Chromium-based (Chrome, Edge).
    * Verify your Pico is properly connected via USB.
    * Check browser permissions and ensure you've granted access to the serial port.
    * The Web Serial API typically requires a secure context (HTTPS) or localhost.
    * Confirm your Pico's firmware is correctly set up for serial communication at **115200 baud rate**.
* **UI Misbehaves:** Try refreshing the page to reset the application state.
* **JSON Import Errors:** Ensure the pasted JSON strictly follows the `layers.json` structure expected by the application.
