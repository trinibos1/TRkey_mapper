# 🖥️ Micropad Web App (3×3 Macro Keypad Mapper)

A cross-platform web-based configuration tool for a 3×3 micropad powered by an ESP32. This app allows you to map custom shortcuts for Windows, macOS, and Linux, including application-specific profiles for Fusion 360, KiCad, and Canva.

## 🌐 Features

- 🔌 **Web Serial Communication**: Connect to the micropad directly from the browser (Chrome-based).
- 🧠 **Smart OS Detection**: Automatically detects the user's operating system and adjusts shortcuts accordingly.
- 🎨 **App-Specific Modes**: Built-in shortcut presets for:
  - Fusion 360
  - KiCad
  - Canva
- 🎛️ **3×3 Interactive Key Mapping**: Click any key to assign commands or shortcuts.
- 🎵 **Media Control**: Assign media keys like volume up/down, play/pause, etc.
- 💾 **EEPROM Synchronization**: Saves configurations directly to your micropad’s memory.
- 📦 **Modern UI**: Inspired by VIA configurator and designed for clarity and dark themes.
