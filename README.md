## Development Notes

- The app uses **Web Serial API** for direct USB serial communication ‚Äî only supported on desktop Chromium browsers.
- Profiles are stored in **localStorage** to persist mappings between sessions.
- The **QR code generator** uses [QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs).
- UI interactions use **CSS transitions** and **flexbox/grid** for responsive design.
- Drag-and-drop uses native HTML5 Drag and Drop API.
- Modifier toggles dynamically prepend to keys on assignment.
- Shortcut suggestions can be extended by editing `presets` and `iconMap` in `app.js`.

---

## Extending the App

- Add new app presets by editing the `presets` object in `app.js`.
- Add custom icons by extending the `iconMap`.
- Integrate WebHID/Gamepad support for advanced device input handling.
- Improve profiles UI with import/export JSON files.

---

## Troubleshooting
